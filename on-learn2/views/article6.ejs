                    <h2><strong>Full-Stack Development: Learn It Because You Want To</strong></h2>
                    <p>You should learn full-stack development because you want to. We know that seems like a pretty
                        obvious statement, but it’s an important one to emphasize. After all, it’s possible to dedicate
                        yourself to front-end or back-end development and ignore everything else. It’s also possible to
                        pursue a career in another field outside of development. So, why should you learn full-stack
                        development? First, because you want to. Second, because full-stack developers are prepared.

                    <img src="/assets/images/6-1.png" class="bodyImg">
                    <p>Full-stack development includes both the front-end and the back-end of the development cycle. A
                        full-stack developer understands and can work on whichever part of the cycle is needed. They may
                        specialize in one or several front-end and back-end programming languages. Learning a full-stack
                        can be beneficial for allowing a developer to do more in the development industry.

                    <img src="/assets/images/6-2.png" class="bodyImg">
                    <p>When you learn full-stack development, you have to learn more, but that doesn’t in itself make
                        learning full-stack development hard. By learning both the front-end and back-end of the
                        development cycle, you may find it easier to evolve and grow as a developer. In contrast, you
                        may find it hard to only learn and work in front-end or back-end development. And, by knowing
                        full-stack development, you allow yourself the opportunity to choose which area you prefer.
