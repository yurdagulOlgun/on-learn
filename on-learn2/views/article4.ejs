                    <br><br><br>
                    <h2><strong>What Should I Learn To Become A Python Programmer?</strong></h2>
                    <p>Since the programming language Python has been around for a while, there’s a lot of information
                        out there, some of it practical, some of it relevant, and a lot of it overwhelming. In order to
                        become a Python programmer, you need to weed out the irrelevant stuff and focus on starting
                        where you’re at. If you’re a beginner, then you’ll need to start by learning the basics of
                        coding.
                        <br><br>
                        Once you learn the basics of coding, here’s what you should probably focus on learning to become
                        a Python programmer or software engineer.

                    <img src="/assets/images/4-1.png" class="bodyImg">
                    <p>Of course, you don’t need to be a natural-born problem-solver, and you don’t need to use a
                        framework to program with Python, but these are two of the most important skills you can learn
                        if you’re serious about becoming a professional Python programmer.
                        <br><br>
                        Working with a powerful framework like Django or Flask can help speed up development time and
                        improve collaboration between programmers. The frameworks are built in a way that allows you to
                        focus on writing code that improves the stability and performance of a project without having
                        you think about and tinker with tedious and repetitive tasks.

                    <img src="/assets/images/4-2.png" class="bodyImg">
                    <p>Version control is a good skill to learn, but it’s not entirely necessary when you’re the only
                        programmer working on personal projects. However, when you work with other programmers,
                        especially on large, ongoing projects, it’s essential. Version control is how massive amounts of
                        Python code don’t break down over time with people constantly working on the project.
                        <br><br>
                        You can learn how to use GitHub to push, pull, fork, and commit changes to a project.
                        <br><br>
                        Using Python libraries goes hand-in-hand with using frameworks. Object-relational mapping (ORM)
                        libraries help you work with data by utilizing a database, so you don’t have to write the same
                        (or nearly identical) code for every project you work on.
                        <br><br>
                        Popular ORM libraries include Django ORM and SQLAlchemy.

                    <img src="/assets/images/4-3.png" class="bodyImg">
                    <p> Even if you decide to specialize in Python as a programmer, chances are you will need to learn
                        and understand additional programming languages and technologies to be successful. Python can be
                        used for both front-end and back-end work, but it’s known for being a back-end language, so you
                        should pick up front-end skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        <br><br>
                        You should also immerse yourself in the world of programming by listening to podcasts, watching
                        videos, and staying up to date with the latest news.
